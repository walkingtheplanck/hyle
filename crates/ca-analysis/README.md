# hyle-ca-analysis

Shared analysis and diagnostics for the [Hyle](https://github.com/walkingtheplanck/hyle) cellular automaton framework.

This crate builds on [`hyle-ca-interface`](https://crates.io/crates/hyle-ca-interface) and provides
**derived tooling** over declarative blueprints:
- static spec summaries
- rule and neighborhood diagnostics

It intentionally does **not** execute simulations. Solvers consume the same
contracts directly; this crate helps inspect them consistently.

## Quick Start

```rust
use hyle_ca_analysis::analyze_spec;
use hyle_ca_interface::{neighbors, Blueprint, CellModel, CellSchema, StateDef};

#[derive(Copy, Clone, Default, PartialEq, Eq)]
enum LifeCell {
    #[default]
    Dead,
    Alive,
}

const LIFE_CELL_STATES: [StateDef; 2] = [StateDef::new("Dead"), StateDef::new("Alive")];

impl CellModel for LifeCell {
    fn schema() -> CellSchema {
        CellSchema::enumeration("LifeCell", &LIFE_CELL_STATES)
    }
}

let spec = Blueprint::<LifeCell>::builder()
    .rules(|rules| {
        rules.when(LifeCell::Dead)
            .require(neighbors(LifeCell::Alive).count().eq(3))
            .becomes(LifeCell::Alive);
    })
    .build()?;

let analysis = analyze_spec(&spec);
assert_eq!(analysis.summary.rule_count, 1);
# Ok::<(), hyle_ca_interface::BuildError>(())
```

## What It Analyzes

### Spec Analysis

- summary data such as rule count, neighborhood count, and max radius
- unused named neighborhoods
- duplicate rules
- rules shadowed by earlier unconditional rules
